# Example

{%- include example-bitbtn.html -%}

# How it works

- The button triggers a **BIP21 URI deep link**.
- It asks the OS of the user to open a program that knows how to open such URIs.
- If the user has a compatible Bitcoin SV wallet, he can make the payment.
- If the user has no Bitcoin wallet, he will be shown a modal window with alternatives.
- The alternatives include a list of reccomended wallets to download (for the OS of the user).
- If the user is on a desktop machine, a QR code is shown to scan with a mobile device.

# Known Issues

- Not tested on all browsers.
- Not tested on all devices.
- Recognising if the deep link succeeded or failed can be hard on iOS.
    - Testing & workaround is needed.
- While using BIP21, the button CAN NOT check if the payments were successful (due to race conditions).
    - Please perform such **checks in your own code** (by generating a separate bitcoin address for each user).
    - This is a temporary problem, and will be resolved when the **Output URI BIP** gets fully implemented.
