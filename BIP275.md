# How Did You Get Here?

If you are reading this, you most likely triggered a BIP-275 URI (probably by clicking a BitBtn somewhere).
<br/> This page was registered as a handler for that specific URI scheme.
<br/> This page exists to spread awareness about BIP-275 and to help you figure out how to use it.

# How Is BIP-275 Supposed To Work?

In simple terms:
- You click on a link containing a complex payment request.
- Your wallet opens up and asks you if you want to send that payment.
- You approve the payment.
- Your wallet sends the transaction data to a BIP-270 receiver server.
- The receiver broadcasts the transaction to the Bitcoin network
- The receiver notifies your wallet that everything went well.
- Your wallet tells you that everything went well.

**Basically - it's P2P payments made easy!**

# Why Didn't Your Wallet Open Instead Of This Page?

There are multiple possible reasons.
- Maybe your wallet doesn't support BIP-275 yet. (Why not send them an email and ask them to change that?)
- Maybe you have a supported wallet, but your operating system considers this page as the default handler for that scheme. (I will include guides on how to fix that at a later time.)
