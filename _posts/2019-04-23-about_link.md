Not all data should be public.

The Bitcoin blockchain provides you access to some never seen before properties.
Its immutability is a new way to think about data, a new way to think about proofs.
Its public ledger incentivises honesty and transperency.

But not all data should be public.

LINK uses strong encryption to help you to get these benefits, while keeping your privacy.

## LINK

LINK is a tool that lets you easily upload and share encrypted data on the Bitcoin SV blockchain.
Each file is encrypted wit an unique key, which can later be used to restore that file.

Using LINK is simple:
- To **upload**, just drag the files to the tool and pay the upload fees (using MoneyButton).
- The tool will **generate an unique URL** containing the data address and the decryption key. Do not lose this URL.
- Simply **clicking on that URL** will decrypt the data and prepare it for download.
- Everything happens **in your browser only**. Not even BitSent has access to your decryption keys.
